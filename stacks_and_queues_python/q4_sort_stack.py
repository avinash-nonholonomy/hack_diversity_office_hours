Sort Stack
Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You
can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into
any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following
operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty
var stack = Stack<Int>()
stack.push(-1)
stack.push(3)
stack.push(5)
stack.push(20)
stack.push(0)
sort(stack: &stack)
